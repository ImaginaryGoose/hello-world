Just another repository

Hello,

My name is Paul Krajicek. I'm currently a BSE Electrical Engineering student at Arizona State University working on my Sophmore engineering classes. I've recently changed majors to Information Technology because of time and teaching staff here. I plan on continuing to work on my coding and Arduino projects despite my recent change in majors. I look forward to learning and sharing my projects with everyone.
